## Charity Connection Dapp

I had recently working on a Decentralized app with name "Charity Connection". It aims to create a platform for people to donate Ethereum (ETH) directly to those in need without the need for intermediaries using Metamask Wallet.
This platform is built using a combination of cutting-edge technologies including Red Hat, React.js, and Web3.js. By using a decentralized platform, we are able to ensure that donations are secure, transparent, and reach the intended recipients without any unnecessary delays or faults. Learned a lot through this project. YouTube is really the "KING".
